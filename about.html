        There are many things in the world that I love to learn more about. 
        Mathematics has been a beacon of curiosity from the beginning of my life. 
        In recent years one of my favorite subjects is differential equations.
        Specifically, their applications to physical and social phenomona have become a central drive for my studies.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also have a great appreciation for combinatorics intersection between geometry, computation and topology.
        This was drawn to me originally when I was introduced to modular origami. 
        Although a great passtime, it has rich mathematical roots.
        <br>
        <br>
        Right next to the world of math, the study of electronics and programming is important to me. 
        The advancements of robotics and AI has been one of my focuses throughout my studies. 
        Developing solutions for cost effienct, industrial interaction, and swarm behvaior for bots has been particularly intresting to me.

        In my free time I like to spend time outdoors as much as I can. 
        Whether it is swimming, fishing, hiking or camping, I need to be there.
        Although, when I don't quite get the time to be outside, I take some time to play games.
        I had played football since I was 4 to the end of high school, and that's where my interest in games began.
        Now that I am out of the sports world, I stick to board or video games.
        If I am going for board games, I casually play chess and peg solitaire.
        For video games, I have spent lots of time on Terraria and Gang Beats.
