            Quanticity is a robotics startup in Chicago, IL.
            Here I was tasked with researching and developing a battery for the rover ground module.
            Some of my day to day duties would be circuit analysis, materials research and diagramming/drafting models.

            Particle Swarm Optimization is a common way to represent a Swarm behavior in order to solve
            a multitude of problems in engineering. The purpose of this project will be to augment the PSO algorithm
            to represent the dynamics of a swarm in different environments.
